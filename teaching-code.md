## Don't suck at teaching

#### Bloom's Taxonomy (80/20 Rule)
80% of learning is *Create, Evaluate, Analyze, Apply*
20% is *Understand, Remember*

The __zone of proximal development__. (Things the learner can do with help) bridges the gap.

__Scaffolding__ - give the learner part of the solution, not all of the solution.
1. Break up the larger problem into smaller ones.
2. How to implement and integrate the smaller functions.

2. Scale back the difficulty
3. Give them more practice on the weak areas.
4. Give encouragement.
